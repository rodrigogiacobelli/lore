## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-31

First release. Lore is the task engine and project memory system at the base of the
Camelot stack. It was built entirely by AI agents tracking their own work in Lore itself.

### Added

#### Task Engine
- **Quests** — named bodies of work with priorities (0–4), statuses (`open`, `in_progress`,
  `closed`), and optional auto-close when all missions are done
- **Missions** — individual executable tasks attached to a quest or standalone; support
  `open`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, and `closed` states with block reasons
- **Dependencies** — `lore needs` / `lore unneed` create directed "blocks" edges between
  missions; `lore ready` only surfaces work whose dependencies are fully closed
- **Claim / done / block / unblock** — lifecycle commands for orchestrators and worker agents
- **Board messages** — lightweight async communication channel per quest or mission

#### Project Memory (Codex)
- **Codex** — queryable knowledge graph of typed markdown documents stored in `.lore/codex/`;
  documents carry `id`, `title`, `summary` frontmatter and a `related` list for graph links
- **`lore codex search`** — case-insensitive keyword search across titles and summaries
- **`lore codex map`** — BFS traversal up to N hops from any document
- **`lore codex chaos`** — random-walk traversal with configurable coverage threshold (30–100%)

#### Knight Personas
- Knights are markdown files that define how an agent should behave for a class of work
- `lore show <mission-id>` returns the assigned Knight's full content alongside mission details,
  so agents receive persona and task in a single call

#### Doctrine Workflow Templates
- Doctrines are YAML templates that define ordered, dependency-linked steps for a body of work
- Cycle detection prevents invalid dependency graphs at creation time
- The `/start-quest` skill reads a doctrine and materialises it as a quest with missions

#### Artifacts & Watchers
- **Artifacts** — reusable document templates agents scaffold new files from
- **Watchers** — YAML definitions for agents that monitor and react to project state

#### CLI & Python API
- Full Click-based CLI (`lore [command]`) covering every operation
- Immutable frozen-dataclass public API in `lore.models.__all__` — stable across semver minor
  versions; internal modules are not part of the public contract
- `--json` flag on all read commands for machine-readable output
- `lore init` bootstraps a project with default doctrines, knights, artifacts, watchers, and
  the Claude skills needed for Realm integration

#### Infrastructure
- SQLite backend with WAL mode, 5-second busy timeout, and foreign-key enforcement
- Schema auto-migration (v1 → v6) on first connection
- Soft deletion throughout — entities carry `deleted_at` and are excluded from normal listings
  without losing referential integrity
- `lore oracle` generates human-readable markdown reports in `.lore/reports/`
- `lore stats` provides aggregate counts across all quests and missions
